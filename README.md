# HuffmanCompressor
Compresses a text file by using a binary tree to make the most common characters take up less bits. Programmed in Java. HuffmanCompressor.java is the driver class. There are many text files to test from. First you choose a text file, then you make a huffman code for it which will make a file named "filename.code". Next you compress the file which will make a file named "filename.short". These two files are what you would send as a message to someone for them to decompress and see the original message (Of course they would need the program to decompress the file using the huffman code). Finally you can decompress the file which will make a file named "filename.new" which will have the same message as the original text file.
